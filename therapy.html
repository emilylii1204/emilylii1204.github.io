      <div class="body mt-7 w-8/12">A lot of children do not have the resources and have a hard time understanding and expressing their feelings. Having a healthy mind starts from when we are kids. This app is all about helping young minds and their therapists team up, it is like a trusty sidekick, making it easy to share thoughts with user’s therapist. Journalling has been proven to help with mental health, but what about in this era with digital screens? Therapists can really get what's going on with their little clients, see how they are doing, and figure out how to make things even better.</div>

      <div class="title mt-24 mb-5 w-8/12">Illustrations</div>
      <div class="body mt-7 w-8/12">The use of colors and shapes, including blobs or simple geometric forms, is a widely recognized and effective method for retaining information in children's education and cognitive development. Colors have psychological and emotional connotations and they stimulate the visual senses and capture a child's attention. While shapes are basic forms that children learn to recognize at an early age. Combining both engages multiple sensory and enhances the encoding of information in memory.</div>
